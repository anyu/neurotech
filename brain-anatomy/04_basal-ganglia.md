# Basal Ganglia (aka. BG)

The basal ganglia are a group of subcorticalstructures deep within the cerebral hemispheres.

The main components are:
- striatum (includes the **caudate nucleus** and the **putamen**)
- globus pallidus
- subthalamic nucelus
- substantia nigra

### Striatum
- divided into the **dorsal** and **ventral** striatum
- largest nucleus of the BG
- receives direct input from most regions of the cerebral cortex and limbic structures
- receives indirect input from sensorimotor regions of the brainstem via the thalamus
- receives other input via the substantia nigra pars compacta (dopamine) and the raphe nuclei (serotonin) in the midbrain
- its principal cell type (>90% of all neurons) is the **GABAergic**, **medium spiny neurone** (aka. MSNs, or spiny projection neurons - SPNs)

#### Caudate nucleus + putamen
-  often considered together, they collectively can be considered the "entrance" to the BG as they work together to receive input from the cerebral cortex
- the caudate nucleus is a C-shaped structure below the cerebral cortex next to the lateral ventricles on each side of brain
- the putamen is a round structure located at the base of the forebrain and is the outermost portion of the BG
- the caudate and putamen are linked by by 'bridges' of grey matter 

### Globus pallidus

Contains 2 parts: 
- **globus pallidus pars externa (GPe)**
- **globus pallidus pars interna (GPi)**

#### GPi
- one of two output nuclei that receive inputs from other BG nuclei
- provides output to external targets in the thalamus and brainstem
- receives inhibitory GABAergic from the striatum and GPE, excitatory glutamatergic input from the subthalamic nucleus
- GPi neurons are GABAergic and exert powerful inhibitory effects on tagets in the thalamus

#### GPe
- the principal "intrinsic" structure of the BG, since its major connections are w/ other BG nuclei
- receives inhibitory input from the striatum
- receives excitatory input from the thalamus
- provides inhibitory efferent connections to all the BG's input and output nuclei

### Substantia nigra

Contains 2 parts: 
- **substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc)**
- **substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr)**

#### SNpc
- obtains input from the putamen and caudate; sends info back
- produces dopamine

#### SNpr
- also obtains input from putamen and caudate, but sends the input outside the BG to control head and eye movements

### Subthalamic nucleus
- an important relay in the 'indirect output pathway' from the striatum via the globus pallidus external (GPe)
- also a second important input nucleus of the BG
- its principal cell type is immunoreactive for glutamate and sends excitatory projections to both the BG output nuclei and the GPe

## Pathways

A popular hypothesis is that there are different pathways that promote and inhibit movement.

### Direct pathway

- Thought to regulate the activity of **glutamate neurons** in the thalamus that map to motor regions in the cerebral cortex.
- When a movement is desired, information about the moment is sent from the motor areas of the cerebral cortex to the **striatum** (main input area of the basal ganglia).
- Glutamate neurons in the **corticostriatal pathway** excite neurons in the striatum, which causes them to release the neurotransmitter **GABA** in the **globus pallidus internal** and **substantia nigra pars reticulata**.
- GABA inhibits activity in these regions and stops them from inhibiting the neurons in the thalamus that are involved w/ movement.

### Indirect pathway

- Thought to play an opposing role to the direct pathway; involved in inhibition of movement.
- When the indirect patheway is activated, GABA neurons in the striatum are activated, which project to the **globus pallidus external** and inhibits neuron activity there. This keeps the GPe neurons from being able to inhibit neurons in the subthalamic nucleus.
