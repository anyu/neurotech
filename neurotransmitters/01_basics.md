# Neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are the body's chemical messengers.

They carry signals/ messages from one nerve cell to another.

There are at least 60+ neurotransmitters in the human nervous system, but may be 100+. 

## Anatomy

- neurotransmitters are located in the **axon terminal** of the neuron.
- stored within walled sacs called **synaptic vesicles**

## Mechanism of neurotransmission

Neurotransmitters transmit one of 3 actions in their messages:

- **excitatory**: excites the neuron and causes it to 'fire the message' to the next cell
- **inhibitory**: blocks/prevents a chemical message from being passed farther
- **modulatory (aka. neuromodulators)**: influence the effects of other chemical messengers and adjust how cells communicate at the synapse

### Excitatory
- glutamate (Glu)
- acetylcholine (ACh)
- histamine
- dopamine (DA)
- norepinephrine (NE), aka noradrenaline (NAd)
- epinephrine (Epi), aka adrenaline (Ad)

### Inhibitory
- gamma-Aminobutyric (GABA)
- serotonin (5-HT)
- dopamine (DA)

### Modulatory
- dopamine (DA)
- serotonin (5-HT)
- histamine
- norepinephrine (NE)

### Neurohormones
- oxytocin (Oxt)
- vasoopressin, aka antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
