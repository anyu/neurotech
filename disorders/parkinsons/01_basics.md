# Parkinson's Disease

## The Basics
A lifelong progressive disorder of the central nervous system that primarily affects the motor system, but also has non-motor impacts particularly over time.

### Symptoms

There is wide variability, but in general:

- **Motor**: tremors, slowed movement (bradykinesia), rigidity, difficulty walking, impaired balance
- **Cognitive**: depression, anxiety, apathy, memory loss, sleep issues, dementia

There is currently no blood/lab tests that can diagnose non-genetic cases.
Diagnoses are done via medical history + neurological examination.

### Causes

Neurons in the **basal ganglia** (specifically in the *substantia nigra* which controls movement and produces dopamine) get impaired or die. The cause of this is not well understood, but "the build-up of misfolded proteins into **Lewy bodies** in the neurons" is likely relevant.

~10-15% of cases are hereditary. Researchers suspect a combo of genetic+environmental factors. 

### Prevention/Treatment

- There is some loose indication that exercise in mid age + caffeine consumption could decrease risk
- Medication exists to reduce effect of symptoms, but become less effective.
  - common medications: levodopa/carbidopa combinations
- Deep brain stimulation (DBS). Invasive surgery where electrodes are placed in specific areas of the brain (usually subthalamic nucleus or global pallidus interna) and connected to a battery-powered device (the "neurostimulator") placed below the collarbone that delivers electrical pulses through the electrodes. See [DBS](02_dbs.md).

### Stats
- ~1mil out of 330mil people in the US have PD
- ~60k American diagnoses each year
- ~10 to 20mil worldwide may have PD
- average onset age is 60, but there are early onsets
- affects more men than women, though anyone is at risk
