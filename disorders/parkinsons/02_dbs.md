# Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)

## How it works

DBS works by interrupting the irregular signals that cause tremors and other movement symptoms.

A DBS system consists of 3 parts implanted in the body:

1. **neurostimulator**: a programmable battery-powered pacemaker-like device that creates electric pulses. It's generally implanted below the collarbone.
2. **lead (aka. wires)**: a coated wire with electrodes at the tip that deliver electric pulses to brain tissue. It's implanted in the brain and connects to an extension wire through a hole in the skull.
3. **extension**: an insulated wire that connects the lead to the neurostimulator. It's implanted under the skin and runs from the scalp behind the ear and down the neck to the chest.

The patient uses a handheld controller to turn the DBS system on/off. 

The doctor programs the neurostimulator settings to deliver electric signals.

## Who it's suitable for

- patients with uncontrollable tremor for whom medications haven't been effective
- patients with symptoms that respond well to medications but get severe motor withdrawal symptoms when drugs wear off
- patients whose movement symptoms might respond to higher or more frequent medication doses but are limited to do so due to side effects

DBS is effective at reducing dyskinesias.

## Types of DBS devices

The FDA has approved a few DBS devices. Generally, rechargeable batteries last up to ~15 years; non-rechargeable last 3-5 years.

| Company | Device  | FDA approval year | Key features | 
| :------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:-------------
| Abbott  | Infinity  | 2016 | - allows directional stimulation<br>- operates Apple iOS software<br>- non-rechargeable battery<br>- device can be remotely programmed via WiFi<br>
| Medtronic  | Activa  | 1997 | - 2 different batteris: one rechargeable, one not
|   | Percept  | 2020 | - can sense/record an individual's unique brain signals (doctors can correlate symptoms w/ brain signals)<br>- allows directional stimulation that can target symptoms in a more focused way, lessening side effects<br>- patients can track their medications/symptoms in a handheld device
| Boston Scientific  | Vercise  | 2017 | - allows directional stimulation (via a diff technique than Abbott/Medtronic's)<br>- 3 diff models (rechargeable or not, some let the clinician visualize models of where the leads are in the brain)

## Medtronic Percept PC Neurostimulator w/ Brainsense Technology

- BrainSense allows clincians to record a patient's brain signals (specifically, local field potentials, LFPs) from neurons in contact w/ the DBS electrode
